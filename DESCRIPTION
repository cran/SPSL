Title: Site Percolation on Square Lattices (SPSL)
Author: Pavel V. Moskalev
Maintainer: Pavel V. Moskalev <moskalefff@gmail.com>
Description: Provides basic functionality for labeling 
        iso- & anisotropic percolation clusters on 2D & 3D square lattices 
        with various lattice sizes, occupation probabilities, von Neumann & 
        Moore (1,d)-neighborhoods, and random variables weighting 
        the percolation lattice sites.
